# bites
A playground.

We use guix as the build orchestrator, delegating to platform build systems (mvn, meson, cargo, node) for the regular experience. This gets us the best of all worlds: interactivity and a normal dev experience, the ability to develop in multiple languages, and first class support in guix (provided I use supported build systems).

As long as the build systems themselves can link against artifacts generated by other build systems (and not have to _drive_ the build themselves) then we should get our dream of building across language boundaries even within the same deployable.
